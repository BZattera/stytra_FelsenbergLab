Introduction
============

Welcome to stytra!
------------------
Stytra is a package to build and run behavioural experiments. It is developed with a focus
on imaging and behavioural experiments on larval zebrafish.


Features
--------
Stytra implements many functions:
    - easily design sequences of (mainly visual) stimuli;
    - acquire video from a camera, and process images to extract behaviourally relevant
    quantities like eyes angles and tail shape or fish position;
    - use these parameters to control the visual stimulation for developing
    closed-loop experiments;
    - collect and save cleanly experiment metadata together with the data
    from the tracking.

- multiprocessing framework to handle video streaming and processing with APIs for
   adding other custom tracking functions;

[bladibibla this should be improved and expanded]
