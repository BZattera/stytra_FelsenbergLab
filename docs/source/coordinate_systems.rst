A note on coordinate systems in Stytra
======================================

Stytra follows the common convention for displaying images on screens: the x axis increases to the right
and the y axis increases downward, with (0,0) being the upper right corner.
For the recorded coordinates, the same holds. The angles correspondingly increase clockwise.
