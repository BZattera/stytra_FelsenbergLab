Hardware description
====================

Below we provide a description of the setups in use in the lab together with a
full list of components that cam be
used to assemble them.

Two configurations are described: the first one is for detailed kinematic
tracking of eyes and tail in a fish with head restrained in agarose, the
second for tracking freely swimming fish in an open arena.


Head-restrained fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration requires high magnification, provided by a 50 mm macro
objective. On the other side, illumination be provided only in a very
small field and can be accomplished by with a simple single IR-LED.

Freely swimming fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration uses a camera with larger field of view and a custom-built
LED box for illuminating homogeneously a large area.

List of components
------------------
Below you can find a list of all components required for building the two
setups. Indicative prices in euros (Jul 2018) and links to
supplier pages are provided as well.


.. note::
    Many parts of the setup, such as the base, the stage and the holders can
    easily be replaced with custom solutions.
