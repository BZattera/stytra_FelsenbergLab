Hardware description
====================

Below we provide a description of the setups in use in the lab together with a
full list of components that can be
used to assemble them.

Two configurations of our setups are described: the first one is for detailed
kinematic
tracking of eyes and tail in a fish with head restrained in agarose, the
second for tracking freely swimming fish in a petri dish.

Finally, we present a cheap version of the behavioural setup that can be
easily built for about 700 euros, and easily assembled using cardboard,
laser-cut parts or other custom-made enclosures.

Head-restrained fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration requires high magnification, provided by a 50 mm macro
objective. On the other side, illumination be provided only in a very
small field and can be accomplished by with a simple single IR-LED.

Freely swimming fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration uses a camera with larger field of view and a custom-built
LED box for illuminating homogeneously a large area.

List of components
------------------
Below we provide a list of all components required for building the two
setups. Indicative prices in euros (Jul 2018) and links to
supplier pages are provided as well.


.. note::
    Many parts of the setup, such as the base, the stage and the holders can
    easily be replaced with custom solutions.

Low-cost behavioural setup
--------------------------
A very cheap version of the behavioural setup can be built by replacing the
projector with small LED display and the camera with a little objective. The
dimensions of this setup are quite small and parts can be kept in place with
a basic custom-made frame that can be laser-cut or even made with cardboard.
