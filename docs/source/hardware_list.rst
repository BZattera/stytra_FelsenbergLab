Hardware list
=============

Below we provide a full list of components that cam be
used to assemble a
behavioural setup like the ones in use in the laboratory without the use of
any additional part. Indicative prices in euros (Jul 2018) and links to
supplier pages are provided as well.

.. note::
    Many parts of the setup, such as the base, the stage and the holders can
    easily be replaced with custom solutions.

Two configurations are considered: the first one is for detailed kinematic
tracking of eyes and tail in a fish with head restrained in agarose, the
second for tracking freely swimming fish in an open arena.


Head-restrained fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration requires high magnification and no need for even
illumination on a large field.

Head-restrained fish setup
--------------------------

This configuration uses a camera with larger field of view and a custom-built
 LED box for illuminating homogeneously a large field of view.
