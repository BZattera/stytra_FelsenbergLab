	abstract = {Pose estimation is crucial for many applications in neuroscience, biomechanics, genetics and beyond. We recently presented a highly efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks called DeepLabCut. Current experiments produce vast amounts of video data, which pose challenges for both storage and analysis. Here we improve the inference speed of DeepLabCut by up to tenfold and benchmark these updates on various CPUs and GPUs. In particular, depending on the frame size, poses can be inferred offline at up to 1200 frames per second (FPS). For instance, 278 x 278 images can be processed at 225 FPS on a GTX 1080 Ti graphics card. Furthermore, we show that DeepLabCut is highly robust to standard video compression (ffmpeg). Compression rates of greater than 1,000 only decrease accuracy by about half a pixel (for 640 x 480 frame size). DeepLabCut{\textquoteright}s speed and robustness to compression can save both time and hardware expenses.},

	abstract = {Larval zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) are a popular model system because of their genetic attributes, transparency and relative simplicity. They have approximately 200 neurons that project from the brainstem into the spinal cord. Many of these neurons can be individually identified and laser-ablated in intact larvae. This should facilitate cellular-level characterization of the descending control of larval behavior patterns. Towards this end, we attempt to describe the range of locomotor behavior patterns exhibited by zebrafish larvae. Using high-speed digital imaging, a variety of swimming and turning behaviors were analyzed in 6- to 9-day-old larval fish. Swimming episodes appeared to fall into two categories, with the point of maximal bending of the larva{\textquoteright}s body occurring either near the mid-body (burst swims) or closer to the tail (slow swims). Burst swims also involved larger-amplitude bending, faster speeds and greater yaw than slow swims. Turning behaviors clearly fell into two distinct categories: fast, large-angle escape turns characteristic of escape responses, and much slower routine turns lacking the large counterbend that often accompanies escape turns. Prey-capture behaviors were also recorded. They were made up of simpler locomotor components that appeared to be similar to routine turns and slow swims. The different behaviors observed were analyzed with regard to possible underlying neural control systems. Our analysis suggests the existence of discrete sets of controlling neurons and helps to explain the need for the roughly 200 spinal-projecting nerve cells in the brainstem of the larval zebrafish.},
