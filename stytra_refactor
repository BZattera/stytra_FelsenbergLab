Refactor purpose:

We have 2 repositories:

Stytra & Portugues Experiment Config

In stytra
    There is no protocol
    General metadata is empty
    There are no Slack notifiers
    There is no database configuration
    Are all stimuli that we use

In Portugues Experiment Config
    Are all protocols, each protocol a separate file
    Python files specifying metadata
    (fish lines, setup names etc are separate text files,
    with 1 entry per line)
